  Based on the following project idea, create two distinct pieces of content:
  1. A complete and professional README.md file using Markdown.
  2. A short, one-sentence project description suitable for a GitHub repository.

  The README.md file must be well-structured and include the following sections:
  - A catchy Project Title.
  - A 'Description' section that expands on the user's idea.
  - A 'Key Features' section with a bulleted list of 3-5 hypothetical features.
  - A 'Getting Started' section with placeholder instructions for 'Installation' and 'Usage'.
  - A brief, standard 'Contributing' section.

  Here is the user's project idea:
  ---
  {project_idea}
  ---

  Your final output must contain the full README.md content first, followed by a clear separator
  like '--- short project description ---', and then the one-sentence description.
